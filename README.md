# Calculator (Based on Tkinter Library)

This is a very simple calculator built by our team to gain some experience in tkinter as well as for project submission in **MLH-INIT DAY-1**

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install tkinter libary to run it directly from source code.

```bash
pip install tkinter
```

## Usage

We have also provided a simple executable file that is generated by us to run the project directly from the file.
Else you can also run it also from your code editor or command line based on your desktop environment.


## Inspiration
Since we are very new to development and wanted to contribute to the community as well as learn from it. We at-least wanted to contribute to the challenge so we took the making a calculator challenge and made a calculator out of it.

## Learning
Learning is the most important thing here in this organisation so we have learned many new as well sharpen old skills as well.
Some of my favourite skills that We learned are Using python to program a GUI app Using tkinter and we also learned about team building
